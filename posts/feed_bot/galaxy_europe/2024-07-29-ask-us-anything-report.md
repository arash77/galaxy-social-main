üìù New blog post released!
https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-07-29-ask-us-anything-report/


üöÄ **First ‚ÄúAsk Us Anything about Galaxy‚Äù live Q\&A session was successful**

Serving and engaging with its user community is one of the key pillars of the Galaxy project. Galaxy beginners and advanced users have many questions around Galaxy concerning data analysis, tools, workflows or the training material. For the very first time, the Galaxy\-EU team offered a live webinar for Galaxy users to ask questions and meet the people behind Galaxy\-EU.


üåü **Questions from beginners and advanced users**

More than 30 scientists followed our invitation and filled this one hour with interesting questions that were answered by experts of our team. It was a well received and great experience for us and we plan to offer this format every 2\-3 months with the next session in September 2024\. Watch the [Events page](https://galaxyproject.org/events) for announcements.
