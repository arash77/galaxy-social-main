Climate Crisis does not wait for your jobs to finish!
=====================================================

The next global #ClimateStrike will take place on **Friday, Sep 20**!

The Freiburg Galaxy Team will express its support directly and will be striking with https://freiburgforfuture.de/. Join us if you are nearby!

To increase awareness in the scientific community, we will pause the job queue for a few hours on Friday.
This means that you can still visit our website, but the server will not start new jobs. Running jobs will not be affected.
