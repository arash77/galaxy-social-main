Climate Crisis does not wait for your jobs to finish!
=====================================================

The next global climate strike will take place on **Friday, September 20th, 2024**!

As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support directly and will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/). Join us if you are nearby!
To raise additional awareness in the scientific community, we decided to pause the job queue for a few hours on Friday.
This means that you can still visit our website, but the server will not start new jobs. Running jobs will not be affected.
