:flag-cz: Getting ready for day 2 of #GCC2024 here in Brno. :flag-cz:

After the traditional annual Galaxy Community update talk we will have two parallel track sessions in the morning,
one focusing on scientific applications of Galaxy, the other on the latest advances of Galaxy, the platform.

The afternoon, like yesterday's, is reserved for workshops, posters and BoFs
- and we are looking forward to the conference dinner tonight in the
Agustinian Starobrněnský klášter!
