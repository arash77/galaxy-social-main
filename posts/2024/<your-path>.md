Galaxy Project is launching a new initiative called BRC-Analytics (https://brc-analytics.org) funded by NIAID. It is a platform for the analysis of pathogen, host, and vector data. Initially it will serve organisms that were previously included in VEuPathDb resource. BRC-Analytics is a collaboration between the Galaxy Project, UCSC Genome Browser, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) with active participation from NCBI Datasets and Comparative Genomics Resource. We are just starting - so please be patient with us we are rapidly developing tools for data exploration and analysis.
