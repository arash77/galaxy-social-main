![Aspidoscelis tigris: A widely distributed species native to the arid landscapes of the southwestern United States. It's a wide-ranging predator that plays an important role in the ecosystem.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Aspidoscelis_tigris/rAspTig1/img/rAspTig1_1.png)

![The sample used to generate the high-accuracy reference genome comes from the subspecies Aspidoscelis tigris stejnegeri, a high-priority species for conservation due to its threatened status caused by habitat loss (Thomson et al, 2016).](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Aspidoscelis_tigris/rAspTig1/img/rAspTig1_2.png)

We have finished the curation of Aspidoscelis tigris (western whiptail), rAspTig1. This is a manually curated update of a genome originally assembled by the California Conservation Genomics Project. Files available on GenomeArk: https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Aspidoscelis_tigris/rAspTig1/assembly_curated/


This is a primary haplotype assembly. Chromosome assignment >99%, BUSCO score 94%.
