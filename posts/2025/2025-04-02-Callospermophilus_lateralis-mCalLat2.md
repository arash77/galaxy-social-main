![Callospermophilus lateralis: Mammals have an incredible ability to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to thrive in extreme climates. The Golden-mantled ground squirrel is a perfect example, dropping its body temperature from 37 degrees Celsius to near 4 degrees Celsius during hiberation!](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Callospermophilus_lateralis/mCalLat2/img/mCalLat2_1.png)

![To survive these extreme temperature changes, these squirrels rely on brown fat, a special type of adipose tissue that gerenates heat without shivering, acting as a natural heater to keep them warm.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Callospermophilus_lateralis/mCalLat2/img/mCalLat2_2.png)

![Scientists are now discovering that brown fat is linked to cardiometabolic health in humans! By studying hibernators, we may unlock new insights into metabolism and potential therapies for human health.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Callospermophilus_lateralis/mCalLat2/img/mCalLat2_3.png)

The Callospermophilus lateralis (golden-mantled ground squirrel), mCalLat2 genome has been assembled, curated, and released on NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_048772815.1/. 


Luke Olsen of the Paul Cohen lab at Rockefeller University aims to use the golden-mantled ground squirrel genome to uncover novel insights into brown fat metabolism and its therapeutic potential.
