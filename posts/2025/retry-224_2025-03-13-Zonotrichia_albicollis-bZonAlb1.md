![Zonotrichia albicollis: The White-throated Sparrow, commonly found across North America, possesses a remarkable genomic feature - a "supergene". This extensive chromosomal rearrangement impacts nearly an entire chromosomal rearrangement impacts nearly an entire chromosome and plays a vital role in shaping the bird's morphology and behavior.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_1.png)

![Half of the individuals carry the rearranged supergene, which significantly impacts their physical traits and actions. This genetic variation crates two distrinct morphs: white and tan.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_2.png)

![These birds follow a unique mating pattern - white morphs exclusively pair with tan mates and vice versa. This unusual system has earned them the nickname "the bird with four sexes."](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Zonotrichia_albicollis/bZonAlb1/img/bZonAlb1_3.png)


The Zonotrichia albicollis (white-throated sparrow), bZonAlb1 genome assembly has been released on NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_047830755.1/. 


Nik Audet, Melanie Couture, et al. at the Millbrook Field Research Center are investigating a unique "supergene" that causes a large chromosomal rearrangement, affecting both their appearance and behavior. This new genome will be an essential tool for their investigations.
